# Powershell-To-Flipper-Template
This is a quickstart templated ducky script that you can copy/paste your powershell code into and achieve code execution on target pc.

# HOW TO USE

** TIPS:
- Make sure to remove Windows carriage-returns if you insert any when copy/pasting code. You can easily remove any by opening the .txt file in Notepad++, selecting 'Edit' > EOL Conversion > Unix (LF)
